# multi_scale_detector

1. the basical detector model was public and the usage of target label generate can see rpn_target_label_generate.ipynb, the usage of inference code please see rpn_inference.ipynb (I reorgnize the Faster RCNN code, and this is different tensorflow version with other github tf version)

2. multi_scale detector will support soon

3. This version only support VOC dataset, will support FDDB Face detector dataset soon

4. The key point regression part will add after I trained the first face detector.

4. The face recognition model will use Hinge Loss, Softmax loss and Center Loss to train.
